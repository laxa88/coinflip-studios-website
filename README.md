# Coinflip Studios React App

This is the React project for [Coinflip Studios webpage](http://coinflipstudios.com/).

There is absolutely no reason to build website as a Single Page App (SPA) due to its current simplicity, but seeing as how React is popular and might be useful in the long run, why not experiment with it using my host and domain?

## Tools and versions used for building this project

- Node version: **4.7.0**
- NPM version: **2.15.11**
- Yarn version: **0.27.5**

## Roadmap

- Set up basic website
- Add unit/component tests
- Set up CI
- Set up CD (if possible)
- Add Google Analytics
- Add Google Ads
